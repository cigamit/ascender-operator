# Ascender Operator

[![CI](https://github.com/ctrliq/ascender-operator/workflows/CI/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/ctrliq/ascender-operator/actions)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache--2.0-blue.svg)](./LICENSE)
[![Operator SDK](https://img.shields.io/badge/built%20with-Operator%20SDK-blue.svg)](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk)

A Kubernetes operator that deploys and manages [Ascender](https://github.com/ctrliq/ascender), built with the [Operator SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk) and Ansible. It reconciles Ascender deployments, their backups and restores, and automation mesh ingress, from custom resources you apply to the cluster.

## Requirements

- A Kubernetes cluster, and `kubectl` configured to reach it
- `helm`, if installing from the chart
- `make`, `nox`, and `molecule`, for development and testing

## Installation

Most users should not install this directly. The [Ascender installer](https://github.com/ctrliq/ascender-install) deploys it as part of a normal install.

To deploy it on its own:

```bash
make deploy
```

## Using the operator

Apply a custom resource describing the deployment you want, then let the operator reconcile it:

```bash
kubectl apply -f awx-demo.yml
```

An automation mesh ingress is declared the same way, using [`awxmeshingress-demo.yml`](./awxmeshingress-demo.yml) as the starting point.

## Configuration

Deployment options are set as fields on the custom resource rather than as operator settings. The `config/` directory holds the CRDs, RBAC, and manager manifests, and `.helm/starter` holds the chart used for Helm-based installs.

## Included content

The operator watches four custom resource kinds in the `awx.ansible.com` group:

- **`AWX`**: the Ascender deployment itself, reconciled by the `installer` role
- **`AWXBackup`**: backup of an existing deployment, including its database
- **`AWXRestore`**: restore of a deployment from a previously taken backup
- **`AWXMeshIngress`**: ingress configuration for Ascender automation mesh

## Testing

Molecule drives the operator test suite, orchestrated through nox.

- **Full suite**: `nox`
- **Molecule directly**: `molecule test`

Smoke tests also run automatically as part of the release workflows, so there is no need to trigger them by hand.

## Release process

Releases normally happen through the Stage Release workflow, which runs smoke tests before publishing.

- The workflow creates a draft release, usually triggered from the Ascender release
- Publishing the draft runs the promote workflow, which pushes the image and chart
- To release the operator independently, run Stage Release in this repository
